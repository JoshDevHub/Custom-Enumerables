# Custom Enumerables

A project where I build my own versions of Ruby's enumerable methods from "scratch". This is mostly an exercise to gain better understanding of 'block' concepts in the Ruby language.

## List of Enumerables

I recreate the following methods in this project:
1. `#each`
2. `#each_with_index`
3. `#select`
4. `#all?`
5. `#any?`
6. `#none?`
7. `#count`
8. `#map`
9. `#inject`

## Tests

I don't have experience with rspec or other ruby testing frameworks yet, so I used a very basic test file using standard output that definitely doesn't cover every single case the enumberable methods can/should cover. I do feel like I fulfill the specifications asked in the challenge on the Odin Project though.
